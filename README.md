# Convert-Array
Solution for "Convert sorted array to binary search tree"

This implementation takes advantage of the property of a sorted array where the middle element of the array will always be the root of the resulting Binary Search Tree. It recursively constructs the left and right subtrees based on the elements before and after the middle element, respectively.
